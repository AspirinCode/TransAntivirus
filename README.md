## Model & data



For the generation stage the model files are available. It is possible to use the ones that are generated during the training step or you can download the ones that we have already generated model files from Google Drive.

## Generation
novel compound generation:

```python
#traindata_new.csv   smiles|aLogP|IUPACName

#finetunev1_new.csv  smiles|aLogP|IUPACName

python gen_t5_real.py  --dataset_dir ./download_pubchem/ --vocab_fn ./vocab/iupac_spm.model --dataset_filename ./finetunev1_new.csv  > gen_real_fine_tune_non.txt
```

## Model Metrics
### MOSES
Molecular Sets (MOSES), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. MOSES implements several popular molecular generation models and provides a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated molecules. With MOSES, MOSES aim to standardize the research on molecular generation and facilitate the sharing and comparison of new models.
